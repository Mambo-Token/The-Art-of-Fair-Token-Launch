# The-Art-of-Fair-Token-Launch
Mambo's concept and approach of fair and sustainabe initial token launch

What is a really fair token launch?
1. Tokens should initially be avaiable (to buy or mint) at the same price and conditions for everybody
2. It should idealy be a widespread distribution
3. Initial whales and shark accumulations should be minimized or not possible. 
This can be done by limiting the maxiumum amount per wallet and per indivudual by collecting social handles at initial sales.
4. No huge allocation for team, devs, cexs, advertising or any kind of how it would be named.
We consider up to 5% as still 100% fair - if all other tokens are distributed.
5. The token creation should be made with reasonable costs. (here fail most of 100% socalled fair mint projects ugly).
6. There should be a preallocation of tokens ready to put in a DEX or swap.
7. There must be funds to fund liquidity for swaps. Funds come only from public sales. Without funds, the token is hanging on thin air. Here fail all so called 100% fair mint projects
8. The majority of funds 70% or more should be used for token liquidity and price support.

This is how Mambo & friens Memecoins are launched!  
$Mambo $Whales $Lion $Rock $Eagle $Manny (The Mammoth)  
Memecoins of friends Mambo helped to deploy with the Mambo fair launch approach:  
$MadMax, $Jumbo $Apes $Banana $Eagles $Eagle  $Yuge $Mama   
$XMAS, $Yeshua, $KING $Jesus $CHRIST  
-.--.-.
And all Solidcoins have to be launched fair, but with solidcoins there is no need to suppress early whales accumulation.
In contrary, it would help a lot to get some liquidity.
Solidcoins are only sold publicly (or partially minted), no closed presales or preallocations.
Preallocations of solidcoins are in such mimimal quantities that it can be ignored:  
Example: for the hard work of https://kas.fyi with all the gathering of logo's and socials for all KRC-20 tokens for free,   
we spend a little amount of tokens into his account (look out for $Gold, $Cafe $Franc...):
